## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- My motivation was to create a wesbsite to study from including what I learned in the prework for this course.
- I built this project to become more familiar with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScipt.
- It helps students coming into the program to study the topics they'll need a basic understand of going into the class.
- I learned the basics about how a website is built, and how a project is organized and managed when working with other developers.
